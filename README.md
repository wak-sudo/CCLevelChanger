It allows the user to select the desirable level.

## Background
There has been some significant work done on the game save files and data files (textures, audio, models etc.). I do not have motivation and time to reverse engineer the whole structure. Nonetheless, the main difficulty of the save editing (checksum protection) has been overcome, so I share this little tool. Enjoy.

## How to build

Build using Visual Studio and .NET Framework 4.8.
